# DanielR-PhocalPoint-GameDev3

Game inspired by titles like Superliminal, Manifold Garden, Stanley Parable. You're in a dystopian-looking world and have to solve puzzles to move on.
LEGEND:
WASD -> Move around 
Hold Shift -> Sprint
Left Mouse Button -> Grab objects
While grabbed, you can: 
-> press T to transform object state
-> hold R to rotate the object via mouse movement

You can also aim at an object and with Right Mouse Button held press T to quickly transform the object state.

PS: There seems to be an issue with level transitioning, so just load each level from Unity idividually afterwards.
